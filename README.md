### Supplementary Material for the Master's Thesis on Random Qubit Rotations

This repository contains supplementary material for the Master's thesis titled "Uncontrollable (?) rotations: Numerical and theoretical analysis of the controllability of randomized rotations on groups, application for randomized single-qubit rotations and utilization of Quantum Signal Processing in the context of Quantum Control Theory" 

The material includes:
- Julia code for numerical simulations
- A collection of animations
- Additional figures and plots
